In general terms, this includes information or an opinion that personally identifies you either directly (e.g. your name) or indirectly.</p>
    <h2>What personal information do we collect?</h2>
    <p>The personal information we collect about you depends on the nature of your dealings with us or what you choose to share with us.
        The personal information we collect about you may include:

        If we collect your sensitive information, we will do so only with your consent, if it is necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to life or health, or as otherwise required or authorised by law, and we take appropriate measures to protect the security of this information.
        You do not have to provide us with your personal information. Where possible, we will give you the option to interact with us anonymously or by using a pseudonym. However, if you choose to deal with us in this way or choose not to provide us with your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with our services or otherwise interact with you.
    </p>
    <h2>How do we collect your personal information?</h2>

        <br>●	marketing and research purposes;
    </p>
    <h2>Disclosure of personal information to third parties</h2>

        <br>●     our professional services advisors;

        <br>Where we disclose your personal information to third parties overseas, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that data security and appropriate privacy practices are maintained. We will only disclose to overseas third parties if:

        <br>●	we reasonably believe that:
        <br>○ the overseas recipient is subject to a law or binding scheme that is, overall, substantially similar to the APPs; and
        <br>○ the law or binding scheme can be enforced; or
        <br>●	the disclosure is required or authorised by an Australian law or court / tribunal order.
    </p>
    <h2>How do we protect your personal information?</h2>
    <p>DogsHaven will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information that we hold about you is kept confidential and secure, including by:

        <br>●	taking measures to restrict access to only personnel who need that personal information to effectively provide services to you;
